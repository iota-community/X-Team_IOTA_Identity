## ðŸŒ³ IOTA Identity Experience Team

The **IOTA Identity Experience Team** is a collaborative effort to provide help, guidance and spotlight to the IOTA Identity Community through offering feedback and introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA Identity](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs).

**IOTA Identity** is an implementation of decentralized digital identity, also known as Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), by the [IOTA Foundation](https://www.iota.org). It implements standards such as [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [Verifiable Credentials (VC)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) from W3C as well as other related (proposed) standards.

**IOTA** is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to securely transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) amongst each other without any fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The [IOTA Identity library](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs) is currently in alpha phase. Hence, we are focused on improving the experience around the following topics:

- ### Documentation
	Documentation includes everything related to writing, curating, and sharing content with solid documentation at every launch, which is kept up-to-date and well-written, with examples and explanations of tangible use cases to stimulate developer interest. This is done mainly within the codebase as comments as well as through the [IOTA Identity Documenation Portal](https://identity.docs.iota.org/).

- ### Quality Assurance & Review
	The Quality Assurance & Review goal includes making sure that the releases are easily usable, have no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn developers off from trying further once they run into them and making sure that the examples we provide are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.

- ### Code Samples Development
	This goal includes code examples and well-presented Proof-of-Concepts to kickstart developers.

- ### Improvements to Module and Libraries
	This goal includes developer-friendly APIs both at release and after release as well as e.g. spotlight for community projects using each of libraries.

- ### Testing Rust Code
	This goal is all about testing the core Rust codebase, coming up with new test cases as well as benchmarking.

- ### Testing and Extending Bindings (WASM, C, Python, Java, Go, ...)
	IOTA Identity will provide several bindings towards the most popular programming languages. This goal is about testing and extending these bindings.

## ðŸ¤” How Can You Get Involved?

Show your interest by adding some information about you through an Application issue here on Github (see [closed issues](https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Identity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)) and join the IOTA Identity Experience Team on the [IOTA Discord](https://discord.iota.org).

## ðŸ‘¥ What to expect?

Weekly meetups to discuss with IOTA Community as well as IOTA Foundation members to exchange ideas and give and receive feedback for the chosen goal(s) or ongoing projects.

This initiative is possible thanks to the contribution of the IOTA Community members and participants will be invited to participate in feedback collecting and evaluating sessions to further push the capabilities of the IOTA Experience Teams.
