Auth Messages contain full DID Documents as before and have no restrictions. The Diff Messages are published to another Address and contain only the differences between 2 DID Documents. They are not restricted in rotating the signing key. A set of Diff Messages can be combined into a single Auth message, removing the need to query them in the future allowing thousands of DID updates without significantly increasing verification time.</p> <h3 id=revocation>Revocation</h3> <p>Besides acting as a decentralized PKI, IOTA is utilized to act as a revocation registry for VCs. Other DID implementations post hashes to the DLT of the revoked VCs. This may not be GDPR compliant. IOTA Identity revokes VCs by deactivating the public key from the DID Document. This requires every public key to be used only once. To prevent DID Documents from having to list thousands of public keys, they can be published via a Merkle Tree. When a key is deactivated, the DID Document will be updated with a bit-flip to indicate which index of the Merkle tree is deactivated. VCs now have a signature that also contains the Issuer public key used for signing and the required hashes for Proof-of-Inclusion in the Issuer Merkle tree.</p> <hr> <p>by Jelle Millenaar from Discord #tech-announcements</p> </article> <hr> <div class=svelte-1ulceh0> <img alt=iota-x-team class=svelte-1ulceh0 src=logo.svg> <p class=svelte-1ulceh0> IOTA Identity X-Team </p> </div> </div> </main> <footer class=svelte-v25qrq> <span> IOTA Identity X-Team </span> </footer> </div></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,{post:{title:"IOTA Identity v0.2 Release",slug:"2021-02-19",html:"\u003Cp\u003EWe have released IOTA Identity v0.2: \u003Ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fiotaledger\u002Fidentity.rs\u002Ftree\u002Fv0.2.0\"\u003Ehttps:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fiotaledger\u002Fidentity.rs\u002Ftree\u002Fv0.2.0\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release has breaking changes with no backward compatibility.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe following is an incomplete changelog for the major changes:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERelocated NPM hosted WASM bindings to @iota\u002Fidentity-wasm\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EIncreased scalability of IOTA Identity\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAllow publishing of collections of public keys\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded 100% GDPR compliant VC Revocation\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERenamed IOTA Identity crate objects to drop the IOTA prefix\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EImproved WASM interface to be easier to use\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003C\u002Ful\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis update went beyond the DID and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) standards and introduced IOTA Identity unique features\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scalability\"\u003EScalability\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have introduced Authentication DID Messages that form an &quot;Auth Chain&quot; and Differentiation DID Messages that form &quot;Diff Chains&quot;.
